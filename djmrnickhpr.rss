      <title><![CDATA[Bridging The Gap~July 2nd, 2019: Sounds from Aotearoa]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[DJ Mermaid comes back to us from a week in Aotearoa (New Zealand) full of mahalo for the tangata whenua (peope of the land) that hosted her so well. Tonight's episode of Bridging The Gap honors the people, places, and language of Aotearoa through the waiata (songs) that the whanau (family) shared with her, along with other music she heard during her time there. From contemporary to more traditional songs, DJ Mermaid takes us along with her on her journey from the opening waiata "Aotearoa" by a collective of contemporary Maori musicians, pays homage to the vibrancy of te reo Māori with the crowd favorite "Whakatō te Kākano", then visits  Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua through the telling the forbidden love story of Hinemoa and Tūtānekai in "Pōkarekare Ana".

Featuring Maori artists like Maisey Rika, Whirimako Black, Stan Walker, Rob Ruha, Uru Whetu, the Patea Maori Club, and so many more, tonight's show is not to be missed.]]></description>

      <itunes:summary>For tonight&apos;s Bridging the Gap, another tribute to a New Orleans legend. Bandleader Dave Bartholomew - an early pioneer of Rhythm &amp; Blues and Rock &amp; Roll - passed away this Sunday at the age of 100. To pay homage, Harrison Patino plays some of his best tracks, along with some of the music of his contemporaries that he so deeply influenced.</itunes:summary>
